# WordToPDF

Whether it's converting 1 '.docx' file to a PDF or 10, this simple script with a visual user interface will convert '.docx' Word documents into PDFs.

The docx2pdf library that does the actual file conversion process does not handle '.doc' Word documents and the other methods I found only seem to work on Windows computers (I'm on a Mac).

I came up with this idea after I had been job hunting these past couple months. After editing the Word document version of my resume, I would then have to click through the Word menus to save the resume into a PDF. However, if I had already closed out of the Word document then I would have to re-open the file and click through the menu system.

I also realized that what if I had multiple versions of my resume I wanted to see as PDFs or if I ever needed to convert many Word files into a PDF, what then?

To convert '.docx' Word files into PDFs, put the Word files you want converted into the folder where this Python script is located on your local computer and run the script. A small box will pop with 2 buttons - Run and Quit.

Click Run to start the conversion process and once it's done another pop up window will let you know it's done. You can close the notification window and Quit the script. Inside the same folder as your Word files, will be PDF versions of your '.docx' files.
